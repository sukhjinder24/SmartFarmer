# SmartFarmer

This Android Application was the part of Smart Farming System.
This makes the use of Weather API, android's messaging system wherein it interacted with the Arduino attached with the GSM module for communicaion.
This Application allows the user to switch On-Off Tubwell motor or any Other equipment(where only a switch needed to be pressed) from a remote location so that user can operate any side-business too along with farming. Also he can check the Soil moisturisation from Arduio connected moisture meter and the weather forcasting from internet on Android Application.
